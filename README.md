## A Special Note 📝

A huge, sarcastic thank you to [ioman](https://github.com/IOMAN1) for calling me an idiot who has never written a single line of code. That's exactly why I'm releasing the source code of this cheat and keeping it open, to highlight just how utterly helpless and noob the game developers truly are. By the way, ioman only made a couple of crappy commits to the [repository](https://github.com/leia-uwu/survev), while the real developer Leia ([leia-uwu](https://github.com/leia-uwu)) did almost all the work.
